# MuffinCSS

**MuffinCSS** is a lightweight, modular CSS package designed to help you create small, reusable CSS classes that scale as your website grows. Write plain old CSS, and MuffinCSS will automatically convert it into atomic CSS, enabling you to keep your codebase clean, maintainable, and efficient.

> **Warning**: This package is in its early development stage. Features and APIs may change without notice.

## Features

- **Atomic CSS Generation**: MuffinCSS allows you to write regular CSS, and it transforms it into atomic, reusable classes.
- **Scalable**: As your project grows, MuffinCSS helps maintain a clean structure by breaking down complex styles into small, modular classes.
- **Simplicity**: No need to learn complex concepts or frameworks; just write CSS like you normally would.
- **Customizable**: Easily extend or override default configurations to suit your needs.

## How It Works

1. Write your standard CSS as you normally would.
2. MuffinCSS processes your CSS and extracts atomic classes.
3. Each atomic class is optimized for reusability and performance.
